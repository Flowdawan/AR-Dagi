# AR-Dagi
This project is an AR application created with aframes which shows animal animations when scanned and food too.

# Test it now

Test this AR-Project under: https://ardagi.deflow.at 

Start to scan some of this images: 
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/tree/main/assets/2d/animals

You can combine them too, for example scan:
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/blob/main/assets/2d/animals/cat.jpg
and:
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/blob/main/assets/2d/food/apple.jpg

After you have scanned an animal with some food you can click the food to feed the animal with it :)

Works best (unfortunately) with Google Chrome
