This project is an AR application created with [mind-ar-js](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js) which shows animal animations when scanned and if combined with food try to click the food to feed the scanned animal.

# Test it now

Test this AR-Project under: https://ardagi.deflow.at 

Start to scan some of this images: 
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/tree/main/assets/2d/animals

You can combine them too, for example scan:
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/blob/main/assets/2d/animals/cat.jpg
and:
https://github.com/Flowdawan/AR-Dagi/blob/main/assets/2d/food/apple.jpg

After you have scanned an animal with some food you can click the food to feed the animal with it :)

Works best (unfortunately) with Google Chrome

For this project we used the Image tracking as well as "Image Tracking - Multiple Targets" and "Image Tracking - Interactive" features from the mind-ar-js library combined with some basic own JavaScript. We also used Github Actions to automatically trigger a workflow (push to the prod branch) that uploads all data to an FTP server and displays it at [our website](ardagi.deflow.at) to enable a smooth testing.
